## 🚀 Favourite Projects
- 🏆 **Chess Engine (Gambit)** (C++) – Capitalising on human fallibility using opponent modelling
- 📷 **Image Classifier** (Python, PyTorch, NumPy, TensorFlow, Optuna) – Deep learning model for hand drawn digit inference
- 📦 **Asset Management System** (Java, Spring Boot, React, SQL, JDBC) – Full-stack web app for company inventory tracking

## 🏆 Industry Experience
- 📚 **LLM Security Researcher** – Researched defense strategies for backdoor attacks on large language models

## 🔭 Current Projects
- 📜 Developing my own programming language using ART (https://github.com/AJohnstone2007/ART)
- 🏆 Currently working on my chess engine for my dissertation, therefore the public repo is not currently up to date. Private repo available upon request.
